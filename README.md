# Decision Tree Classification Model

In this exercise we create a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm in order to forecast the income levels based off of certain inputs. It uses attributes like occupation, relationship status, age and more to predict whether an individual will make over - under $50,000.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github: 
("https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/tree/master/data")
Or via google drive:
("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rQK9RLq8FMew98wBERoMiyUh2cnT2zJE")

Upon downloading the dataset, we created python notebook for our further 
analysis.
# Code

Python Notebook: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Predictive-Decision-Tree-Model/blob/main/CA03_Dhiman_Sarkar.ipynb")
Google Colab: ("https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15EHEvGcKZ6LMuCT24LVNQSYh7NpMyd8-#scrollTo=yrKIfa407KV-")

# Instructions on how to launch
I. Open the python notebook on google colab.
II.  Mount the Google Drive: drive.mount("/content/drive")
III.  Link the working directories: 
census = "/content/drive/MyDrive/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA03/Data/census_data.csv"
IV. Run the Code
V. Refer to the Tree Tuning Cases File for the best model information  https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Predictive-Decision-Tree-Model/blob/main/Tree%20Tuning%20Cases%20(Dhiman%20Sarkar).xlsx

# Procedures

In order to create our model we followed the following steps:

I. Importing Modules

II. Mounting Google Drive

III. Linking Working Directories

IV. Reading the CSV file

V. Data Inspection and Quality Analysis

VI. Exploratory Data Analysis

VII. Decision Tree Classifier Model

VIII. Decision Tree Generation Using Graphviz (Also included in the previous step)

IX. Tuning Decision Tree Performance

X. Automation

XI. Predicting Using "Trained" Decision Tree Model
